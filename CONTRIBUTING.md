# How to contribute

We appreciate your consideration for this project, and we are always happy to accept more helping hands. Please read over our README.md and our other related resources before engaging in this project.

## Testing

We are using Vitest for http testing. Please write a test for this framework whenever it is necessary.

## Submitting changes

There will be a weekly rotation for a Quality Assurance Contributor role. Tag this specialist in your pull request and wait for them to review it. Do not review your own pull requests for code content. Please reference the issue that this pull request is aiming to solve.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using hard tabs equivalent to four spaces.
  * Please include labels on all issues created.
  * Include clarifying or instructing comments.
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * Use double quotes for strings in JS.
  * Use inline opening brackets when necessary. Close brackets on a new line.
  * Save images to the server to be sent to the web page. Do not include images for the web page to the repository.

Thank you!
